EPO POE Doc Grant Proposal
--------------------------

Abstract:

POE is large, and its existing documentation is not gentle to new
users.  This grant will fund the creation of documents that introduce
new users to POE's basic and intermediate concepts and their usage.

Deliverables:

1. An organized outline of topics that will serve as a specification
for the final deliverable documentation.  The outline will be
submitted to EPO for approval before writing begins.

2. Documents per the topical outline.

Involved:

Rocco Caputo <rcaputo@cpan.org> - Mentor/Manager
