I thought it might be helpful to come up with a coherent design for
POE documentation, get some feedback, and then start rewriting (as
well as sending armed gorillas after anyone who writes module docs
which don't stick to the design.)

Some of this has already been discussed a level up, but rather than
totally refactor that I want to focus on design and then refactor
both.

= Design goals =
* [[/Accuracy]]
* Clarity
* Terseness
* Forward reference reduction
* Sane linkage
* Simple multi-formatting

= Documentation types =
* Intro/tutorial
* Overview
* Cookbook
* Reference
* Module

What I want is general spec covering the goals for each type (i.e.
thirty <i>short, concise</i> wiki pages, plus a few introductory pages
like this one.  I am just going to bull ahead with this, and
(eventually) hit the mailing list(s) to try to get people in here to
comment.
