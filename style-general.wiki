== The Elements of Style ==

This section discusses typographical and syntactical conventions used
throughout POE's documentation.

=== Capitalization (c12n) ===

People expect ``kernel'' to mean the operating system's, not POE's.
Session also has a meaning in Unix, and while there's a little overlap
between that meaning and POE's, it's different and similar enough at
the same time to be confusing.

Capitalize the names of POE classes to distinguish them from operating
system constructs.  Preface them with ``POE's'' now and again to keep
the reader oriented.
